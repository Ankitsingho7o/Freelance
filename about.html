          In the winter of 2007 I lost my job(LONG STORY) of 7+ years. I was the
          #1 sale person in the nation for my company for 3 years straight(true
          story). I was lost, I didn't know what to do. Months passed and I
          still wasn't working. I honestly didn't look for work because I was
          still in shock from what happened. I had been in the same routine for
          years and that routine was broken. After months and months of not
          working, I had to find something to supplement the income I had lost
          on a monthly basis because I couldn't live off my savings forever.
          What did I do next? It wasn't the easiest decision but I sold my shoe
          collection. Since middle school I always loved shoes. Growing up my
          parents didn't buy me the newest shoes or the best shoes because I
          didn't always take the best care of them. Once I started working in
          high school I always saved my money to buy a fresh pair as often as I
          could. Then once I got a "real" job and started making decent money I
          bought shoes a few times a month and multiples at a time to make up
          for all the shoes I didn't get as kid and something to collect as it's
          been a passion of mine since I can remember. Over the years I amassed
          a collection of a few hundred pairs. About half new and half worn.
          When I use to collect I believed in the "rock one, stock one" theme.
          Up until the day I decided to sell my collection I NEVER sold a pair
          of shoes in my life. I never thought of it as a business or a way to
          make money in the future. I literally didn't know where to start but I
          knew that I needed to sell them to take care of the NEEDS in my life.
